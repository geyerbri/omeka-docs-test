This took a bit to figure out, **Ethan**. But I think I've got it. If you'll let me do the other work, starting when I said, then I think I can get a site that looks like this to work now for everyone else to start on their documentation.

The sections of this manual correspond to the navigation sections on the left-hand side of the [administrative dashboard](admin-dashboard.md) of an Omeka S Installation: 

**Sites**  
Creating, editing, and managing sites, the public-facing parts of an Omeka S installation.

**Resources**  
Creating, editing, and managing the content of an installation: items, item sets, media, vocabularies, and resource templates.

**Admin**  
Access to functionality in the admin section varies by user role, but can include: users, jobs, and settings.

**Modules**  
This section opens with basic information on managing the modules which extend the functionality of your Omeka S installation and sites. It then offers specific documentaiton for Omeka S modules created by RRCHNM, listed in alphabetial order.

This manual also includes a [glossary](glossary.md), instructions on conducting [searches](search.md), and how to turn on [error logging](errorLogging.md)
