Where appropriate, we have provided a roughly analogous term from Omeka Classic, although some analogies are stronger than others. Class : A kind of Resource, as defined by a Vocabulary. Often, Vocabularies expect particular Properties to be used with particular Classes. For example, a foaf:Person would not have a dcterms:publisher Property, but could be expected to have a foaf:familyName Property. Omeka Classic analogy : Item Type File : Data uploaded to an Omeka S installation and associated directly with an Item (see also: Media). Omeka Classic analogy : File (but the analogy is weak) Global Admin : An administrator who controls everything, and is typically the person who created the Installation. Omeka Classic analogy : Superuser Installation : An instance of Omeka S. Typically, a central IT department of an institution does the process of installing, and probably also creates sites for others. Item : The records used to build an Omeka S Site. Items are shared and available to any Site in an Installation, unless explicitly excluded from sharing. Omeka Classic analogy : Item Item Set : An aggregation of Items. Items can belong to any number of Item Sets. Omeka Classic analogy : Collection, Items with the same tag Media : Additional representations or descriptions of an Item, beyond metadata from vocabularies. Typically, this refers to a File (of any type, including, e.g., text or HTML snippets), but could also refer to external data sources such as a YouTube video, Slideshare deck, Dspace bitstream, etc. - Omeka Classic analogy : File (but the analogy the weak) Property : A defined \u2014 to one degree or another \u2014 kind of metadata used to describe a Resource. The most common is dcterms:title, for the written, human-readable title of an Item. The Values for Properties can be written language intended for humans or other sentient beings to read (\u2018Literals\u2019), Resources (understood here as internal to an Omeka S Installation), or External URIs (e.g., a URI to a DBpedia resource page). Omeka Classic analogy : Element Resource Template : A set of pre-defined Properties, and optionally a Class, to use to guide Item creation and interpretation of Properties. Typical usage is to create a template for, e.g., a foaf:Person that makes Items using that template show the inputs for the expected or desired foaf: properties , and sets the Class of the Item to foaf:Person . Omeka Classic analogy : Item Type (but the analogy is weak) cf. Class Site Admin : An administrator of a single Site within an Omeka S Installation. Omeka Classic analogy : Superuser role Value : The actual data that fills out the Resource-Property-Value triple. If the property is 'dcterms:title', a reasonable Value might be \u201cHeart of Darkness\u201d. Literal Values might also have information about the language in which that Value is expressed attached. Values can also be Resources or URIs to external data (preferably URIs that return RDF data, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to enforce that). Omeka Classic analogy : Element Text Vocabulary : A collection of published RDF metadata Classes and Properties for describing a Resource. These exist and are created externally to Omeka, and can be imported (with some limitations) into Omeka S for use throughout the Installation. The most-used Vocabulary is Dublin Core Terms (dcterms:).

Make a copy of your /modules and /themes directories. Make a copy of your /files directory. Remove all Omeka S files, and replace them with the files from the updated zip file. Replace your original /config/local.config.php and /config/database.ini file, and the /modules , /themes , and /files directories that you copied. In your web browser, go to your site's admin page (yoururl/admin) and run any migrations that are needed. Install on Windows or Mac OS (basic development purpose only) Omeka S does not support proprietary or closed source operating systems. However, for basic development purposes or for quick training, Omeka can run with WAMP , MAMP or similar tools. Follow the standard installation instructions. You will need to make the following configuration changes to the file config/local.config.php to work. First, the php path may need to be set if php. Edit the config file and fill the phpcli_path at line 12 with the appropriate path for your operating system. Second, you need to configure Omeka S to use the thumbnailer which is available in your server.

Public views The exact appearance of the search interface will vary based on the theme selected. However, the way search works should be consistent regardless of theme. All of the screenshots in this section are from a site using the the Default theme. Basic search There is a search bar near the menu for each site. In the default theme, it is located just beneath the main menu, as shown in the image below. This search bar works as a full-text search for the whole site. It will search all of the items, item sets, and media as well as the content of every page published on the site. Results are sorted by type, grouping together page results and item or item set results. From the initial results page, you can view all the results for that type (page, item) using the \"view all results\" link. Advanced item search Site visitors can access an advanced item search from the Browse Items page, if you have that page accessible. There is a link for Advanced search between the pagination and the sort options at the top of the item browse table. Clicking this loads a new page with four options for search: Search full-text: runs a full-text search on all of the text for every item in the installation. Search by value: search for a term or phrase using multiple options. The first selector allows you to specify a property to search. Note that if you have have the site settings to restrict search to templates, this will only display the properties used by those templates. The second selector allows you to set the relationship the property has with the value. The options are: is exactly, is not exactly, contains, does not contain, is resource with ID, is not resource with ID, has any value (there is something in the property), and has no values. Finally, there is a text field for you to enter the value you want the property to have. To find a resource ID, go to the resource and look at the url in your browser's address bar. The numbers at the end of the url are the resource ID. Search by class: select a class by which to search from the dropdown menu Search by item set: select from a dropdown of item sets.

Transifex.net offers several plans, but since Omeka is an open-source project, you can use the Free plan. Join or start a language team Once you have registered for an account, visit the Omeka S project page and click on the \"Help Translate Omeka S\" or \"Join Team\" button. Here, you can choose among all the languages that are already being worked on. If you want to start work on a translation into a new language which isn't listed, you need to request that language first.

In Omeka S, items may belong to any number of sets, and an item set can have any number of items. Item sets are managed via the Item Sets tab (stacked boxes) located in the left navigation of the admin dashboard. After clicking on the tab, a table appears listing all item sets with: their Title ; icons for each row representing options to edit (pencil), delete (trash can), or view details (ellipses); the item set\u2019s Class , the Owner of the set, and the date the set was Created . Above this table on the left is the pagination for the item sets table, where you can click the left and right arrows to move forward and back or enter a page number to go a specific page of item sets. In the center above the table is the button for advanced search . On the right above the table are drop-down menus to re-order the table by title, class, owner, or date created in either ascending or descending order. In the upper right corner is the button to Add new item set . View Item Set To quickly see information about an item set, click on the view details button (ellipses) for the item set on the item sets browse page. This will open a drawer on the right hand side of the page with the item set\u2019s Title, Visibility, and number of Items. To view all the information for an item set, click on its name. On the item sets view page, there are tabs to see an item set\u2019s Metadata and Linked Resources . On the right side of the item set\u2019s view page is information about the date created, owner, and visibility. For item sets, visibility includes both whether the set is private or public and whether other users can add items to the set. The item set\u2019s metadata is entered by users. Linked resources are items which have used the item set to populate specific metadata properties. When viewing linked resources, the table includes the predicate (property or description) and the object (linked item resource). Note that incoming resources (those used as properties for the item set being viewed) will not display here, as they already display in the item set's metadata. To view the items in a set, either click on the number of items in the set on the item set browse page, or click the view items button in the upper right corner of the individual item set page. Add an item set To add a new item set, click the Item Sets tab from the left navigation of the dashboard. Click the add new item set button on the right hand side of the screen. Item sets may use the same resource templates available for items to provide pre-selected fields. Each set should contain at least one descriptive value, such as Dublin Core Description. You may add other fields by selecting a property from the list on the right. Browse fields by vocabulary (Dublin Core, Bibliographic Ontology, etc), or search in the filter properties bar above the list of properties and vocabularies. Values tab You may add text, a resource from the installation, or an external link in each field. By default, a new Item Set will load with the properties dcterms:Title and dcterms:description. You may add other fields by selecting a property from the list on the right. Browse fields by vocabulary (Dublin Core, Bibliographic Ontology, etc), or search in the filter properties bar above the list of properties and vocabularies. You can set individual properties as Private or Publicly visible using the eye icon for each property. Note that properties set to private are still visible to Global Admins, Site Admins, and Editors will be able to see properties even when set to private. Authors will be able to see all properties on items they own, but will not see private properties created by other users. In the image below, the first property (Title) is public as indicated by the open eye icon. The second property (Description) is private as indicated by the slashed-through eye icon. Clicking or hitting enter on the eye icon toggles between public and private. Text Text fields are entered with text. The keyboard at the top of the field input indicates text. You can indicate the language for the content of an input using the globe symbol above the input (see the red arrow in the image below). Click on the globe to activate a text field, then enter the ISO 639-1 code for the language in which the text is written. Omeka Resource These fields create an internal link between the resource you are creating and the resource which fills that field. You have the option to use either another item or an item set. Once you select an item or item set, detailed information will load, and you must click select resource to finish linking the resources. You can also click the X button in the upper right-hand corner to go back to the list of items or item sets. When creating an item set, you have the option to use either another item or an item set.

You can use the search function at the top of the drawer to narrow down the list or to quickly find a specific item or item set Once you select an item or item set, detailed information will load, and you must click select resource to finish linking the resources. You can also click the X button in the upper right-hand corner to go back to the list of items or item sets. If you are using an Item resource for the property, you will have additional options for finding the item you want in the drawer. Open these options by clicking the triangle button next to the phrase \"Filter search\" This will open a menu below the button with the following options to filter the items in the drawer: Filter by class: a dropdown where you can select any class provided by the vocabularies on the installation; Filter by item set: a dropdown where you can limit the items displayed in the drawer to only those associated with a particular item set Filter by item ID: a search field where you can input the ID of the item you want to use. You can find an item's ID in the url of it's edit page; if you are editing the item and the url is admin/item/11547/edit then the item's ID is 11547. Item resources also have an option for \"Quick add\". When this switch is flipped, all of the items in the drawer have a checkbox. You can use these checkboxes to add multiple items as a property at once. Note that you can only edit one property at a time, so all of the items must populate the same property (ex, Creator, Has Part). URI URI fields link to an external website or online resource. You may add other fields by selecting a property from the list on the right. Browse fields by vocabulary (Dublin Core, Bibliographic Ontology, etc), or search in the filter properties bar above the list of properties and vocabularies. Thumbnail tab By default, Omeka S will use the media from the first item added to an item set to generate a thumbnail for the set. If you want to use a non-media image for the thumbnail for an item set you can set it here. The assets you select from and upload as thumbnails in this tab are the same as those created for site logos . To assign an asset as a thumbnail, click on the Select button in the main work area of the tab. This will open a drawer on the right side. The drawer offers two options: upload a file using your browser, or select from existing assets. To select an existing asset, simply click on it and it will automatically be assigned to the item set. To remove an asset which you have assigned as a thumbnail, click the \"Clear\" button below the image of the asset. To replace it, click select and either choose or upload a new thumbnail asset.

Use the make public/private button (eye icon) to make the item visible to the public or only to all users of the Omeka S installation (not public). Open sets can be edited and added to by any user on the install. Closed sets are available and editable only by its creator, site admins, and global admins. Open and Public Closed and Private Note that the public/private and open/closed settings operate independently - you can have an open and private item set, for example. Edit an item set Once you have created an item set, you can edit it at any time, either by clicking the edit icon (pencil button) or clicking on the item set's title and then clicking the Edit button in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. Options for editing an item set are the same as for creating an item set. To cancel out of editing, click the Cancel button in the upper right corner, between the Delete and Save buttons. Batch Editing From the browse page of item sets (admin/item-set) you can batch edit item sets, using the dropdown menu on the upper right near the \"Add new item set\" button. You can select multiple item sets using the checkboxes on the left of each set's row. Batch actions are as follows: Edit selected: edit only the item sets that are selected on the page Edit all: edit all the item sets returned by a search (default is all item sets) Delete selected: delete only the item sets that are selected on the page Delete all: delete all the item sets returned by a search (default is all item sets) Choose one of these options and then click Go .

Just above the table on the right are options for sorting the table of items, with two dropdown menus. The first lets you select between Title , Identifier , Class , Owner, and (Date) Created ; the second allows you to sort ascending or descending. To apply, click the sort button. Between these and the table, on the left, is a dropdown for batch actions, including edit selected, edit all, delete selected, and delete all. View To quickly view the basic information about an item, click the view details (ellipses) button in the row for the item, located next to the edit and delete buttons. This will open a drawer to the right of the list which displays the item\u2019s title, description, and visibility. For a more detailed look at an individual item, click on its title in the items browse table or when viewing its details. The blue squares indicate where to click to open the full item view. When you view an individual item , there are tabs for the item\u2019s Metadata and its Linked Resources . The right side of the page displays the item\u2019s media, any item sets to which it belongs, its creation date, owner, and visibility. An item\u2019s linked resources (shown below) are resources, which are linked to this item through properties. Note that this section only shows resources which have been linked to this item (which have it for a property); resources which are linked from this item will display in the property which they fill. Linked items are grouped by the property for which they use the current item. In the example below, the item William Shakespeare is used for the properties \"Creator,\" \"References,\" and \"list of authors\" for the linked resources. You can filter linked resources to only display those referencing a specific property using the dropdown \"Filter by property.\" It will only display properties actively in use. Adding an Item To add a new item, begin by selecting the the Add new item button. Before creating items, site admins may want to create Resource Templates , which will load specific fields for various item types. Values The Values tab is where you enter metadata, such as title, description, etc. You can select a resource template from the drop-down menu. Resource templates are defined by the site administrators and editors. If using a resource template, the class should automatically load. If not using a resource template, you may select a class from the dropdown menu (these are populated from the Vocabularies in your installation). Add information to the properties which load. If you do not select a resource template or class, the Dublin Core properties Title and Description will load automatically. You may add text, a resource from the installation, or an external link in each field. Whether or not you use a resource template, you can add more properties to the item using the drawer on the right side of the screen. You can simply click open one of the vocabularies and click on the property you want to add, or you can use the \u201cFilter properties\u201d box to search for a specific property (this is helpful when you have multiple large vocabularies). Clicking on the property label in the drawer will automatically add it to the Item. If you add a property by accident, leave it blank and it will be removed from the item when you save changes. You can set individual properties as Private or Publicly visible using the eye icon for each property. Note that properties set to private are still visible to Global Admins, Site Admins, and Editors will be able to see properties even when set to private. Authors will be able to see all properties on items they own, but will not see private properties created by other users. In the image below, the first property (Title) is public as indicated by the open eye icon. The second property (Description) is private as indicated by the slashed-through eye icon. Clicking or hitting enter on the eye icon toggles between public and private. Text Text fields allow for unformatted text entry. You can indicate the language for the content of an input using the globe symbol above the input (see the red arrow in the image below). Click on the globe to activate a text field, then enter the IETF Language tag code for the language in which the text is written. Omeka Resource Omeka Resource fields create an internal link between the resource you are creating and the resource which fills that field. When creating an item, you have the option to use either another item or an item set. Choosing a resource type will open a side drawer where you can browse all of those resources in the installation. You can use the search function at the top of the drawer to narrow down the list or to quickly find a specific item. Once you select an item or item set, detailed information will load, and you must click select resource to finish linking the resources. You can also click the X button in the upper right-hand corner to go back to the list of items or item sets. If you are using an Item resource for the property, you will have additional options for finding the item you want in the drawer. Open these options by clicking the triangle button next to the phrase \"Filter search\" This will open a menu below the button with the following options to filter the items in the drawer: Filter by class: a dropdown where you can select any class provided by the vocabularies on the installation; Filter by item set: a dropdown where you can limit the items displayed in the drawer to only those associated with a particular item set Filter by item ID: a search field where you can input the ID of the item you want to use. You can find an item's ID in the url of it's edit page; if you are editing the item and the url is admin/item/11547/edit then the item's ID is 11547. Item resources also have an option for \"Quick add\". When this switch is flipped, all of the items in the drawer have a checkbox. You can use these checkboxes to add multiple items as a property at once. Note that you can only edit one property at a time, so all of the items must populate the same property (ex, Creator, Has Part). URI URI fields link to an external website or online resource. You may add other fields by selecting a property from the list on the right. Browse fields by vocabulary (Dublin Core, Bibliographic Ontology, etc), or search in the filter properties bar above the list of properties and vocabularies. Language You can indicate the language for the content of an input using the globe symbol above the input (see the red arrow in the image below). Click on the globe to activate a text field, then enter the IETF Language tag for the language in which the text is written. Media Use the Media tab to add images, video, or other files. Using the buttons on the Add New Media menu on the right side of the screen, select a media type (Upload, URL, oEmbed, YouTube, or HTML) Upload : select a file to upload from your computer. URL : import media via a uri. HTML : add html content as a media resource for your item. IIIF : Add an IIIF image via url. oEmbed : insert an embedded representation of an external URL. Note that this will only work with content from existing oEmbed implementations - use the url in your browser\u2019s location bar. YouTube : add a link to embed a YouTube video. Use the url from your browser\u2019s location bar (with /watch/ in it) rather than the youtu.be link. You can edit media later by going by editing an item, navigating to the media tab, and clicking the edit button (pencil) for a media when editing the item. You can delete any media instance from the item's edit page using the delete button (trashcan) on the upper right corner of the media block. If you have more than one media instance for an item, you can reorder them by dragging and drop each media instance block, using the icon of three lines in the upper left corner of the block as the anchor when dragging. Omeka S uses the topmost media for an item to create thumbnail images for that item on browse and show pages. Item Sets You can only add items to existing item sets. From the right-hand menu, click on the owner of an item set, then click the name of the item set to add the item to that set. You can also filter item sets using the text entry bar above the list of users. To remove a connection between an item and item set, click the delete (trash can) button to the right of the item set title. Thumbnail By default, Omeka S will use the topmost media to generate a thumbnail for the item. If you want to use a non-media image for the thumbnail for an item you can set it here. When you use an asset thumbnail instead of uploading media, the asset thumbnail does not display on the item's public show page. This makes such thumbnails useful for items which have no media but which would benefit from a thumbnail for the browse view, or for items whose media does not render an elegant thumbnail, such as audio or visual files. The assets you select from and upload as thumbnails in this tab are the same as those created for site logos . To assign an asset as a thumbnail, click on the Select button in the main work area of the tab. This will open a drawer on the right side. The drawer offers two options: upload a file using your browser, or select from existing assets. To select an existing asset, simply click on it and it will automatically be assigned to the item. To remove an asset which you have assigned as a thumbnail, click the \"Clear\" button below the image of the asset. To replace it, click select and either choose or upload a new thumbnail asset. Visibility Use the make public/private button (eye icon) to set whether the item is visible to the public or only to users of the Omeka S system. Public Private Note that if an item is private, all the media attached is private, but an item which is public can have attached media which are set to be either public or private. Edit an item Once you have created an item, you can edit it at any time, either by clicking the edit icon (pencil button) or clicking on the item's title and then clicking the Edit button in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. To cancel out of editing, click the Cancel button in the upper right corner, between the Delete and Save buttons. Editing options are the same as when creating a new item, with the addition of the ability to add any media which has been saved to an item as a property: Media as property Once you have created an item and added media to it, you will also have the option to use media attached to that item for a property. To use a media resource for a property, select the media option for the element (1). The drawer which opens will display all media attached to the item. Select the media which you want to use(2); this will switch the drawer to just that media (second image). Click the Select Resource button at the bottom of the drawer to complete the process (3). Batch editing From the browse page of items (admin/item) you can batch edit items, using the dropdown menu on the left near the pagination buttons. You can select multiple items using the checkboxes on the left of each item's row. Batch actions are as follows: Edit selected: edit only the items that are selected on the page Edit all: edit all the items returned by a search (default is all items) Delete selected: delete only the items that are selected on the page Delete all: delete all the items returned by a search (default is all items) Choose one of these options and then click Go . Batch editing items takes you to a new page. The items being edited will display on the right side in a drawer, while the batch edit form gives you the following options: set visibility: a dropdown, select from public or not public. set template: a dropdown, select from the installation's resource templates. set class: a dropdown, select from classes of the installed vocabularies. add to item set: a dropdown, select from item sets on the installation. Add to an additional item set using the add another item set button. remove from item set: a dropdown, select from item sets on the installation. Remove from an additional item set using the remove another item set button. clear property values: a dropdown menu with all the properties in all vocabularies, selecting from this will remove any values in that property in the affected items. Clear additional properties using the Clear another property button. In addition, you can use the buttons at the bottom of the batch edit form to add properties to every item: add text value add resource value add URI value Selecting any of these will add a block to the form where you can select a property from the installed vocabularies and enter the value for that property. For the delete actions , a drawer will open on the right side of the screen telling you the number of items which will be deleted. Nothing will be deleted unless you click the red Confirm Delete button. This action cannot be undone. To opt out of deleting the items, click the X in the upper right corner of the deletion drawer.

Please note that an import must have a specific import type. Preparing your CSV file Most spreadsheet editors (including Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, and Apple Numbers) can export to csv format. CSV files for import must be encoded in UTF-8, so when exporting or saving a new document, be sure to check that the encoding is UTF-8. If the spreadsheet is already created, take a moment to think about which columns you want to match to which vocabulary properties. Note Your csv file must have a header row in order for the module to process it correctly. If you have multiple inputs for a single property, you can separate them with a secondary multivalue separator . For example, a work with multiple authors (E.B. White and William Strunk Jr.) with the column for Creator containing \"E.B. White; William Strunk Jr\" has a semicolon (;) as the multivalue separator. When imported into Omeka S, each of these would appear as a separate entry in the property (Creator: E.B. White and Creator: William Strunk Jr.) Automapping The module will automatically automap column headers if they conform to the property terms of your installation's vocabularies . For example, a CSV file with a column header \"dcterms:title\" would automap to the Dublin Core Title property when the CSV is loaded for mapping. To find the terms you should use for your column headers, go to the Vocabularies tab from the admin dashboard. Click on the number of properties for the vocabulary you want to use (Dublin Core in the image below) In the table of vocabulary properties, there is a column for Term . Use the Term for the property you want to automap in the CSV Import. For example, \"dcterms:abstract\" would automap to the Dublin Core property \"Absract\" and \"foaf:firstName\" would automap to the Friend of a Friend property \"firstName\" In addition, there is a setting in the inital import settings to automap with simple labels - this will work with columns whose names match a vocabulary label, for example \"Title\" or \"date\". Note that this option defaults to Dublin Core before proceeding through other installed vocabularies. Initial Import Settings Start an import by clicking on the CSV Importer tab on the left-hand navigation. This will open the initial Import Settings page. For the Spreadsheet option, use the Choose File button to select the file from your computer. From the CSV Column delimiter dropdown, choose from the following options (this should match the formatting of your file) comma (default) semi-colon colon tabulation carriage return space pipe From the CSV column enclosure dropdown, choose the option which encloses long text in your file: double quote (default) quote hash From the Import Type dropdown, select what you are importing: Item Sets Items Media (must relate to already existing Items) Mixed resources (spreadsheet can inlcude Item Sets, Items, and Media) Users Check the box to Automap with simple labels. This will automap not only specially formatted column headings but also column headings which match existing vocabulary property labels. Note that this option defaults to Dublin Core before proceeding through other installed vocabularies. Comments are useful as they appear on the \"Past Imports\" page; make a note about what is being imported and any settings you may have on this page. Click the next button to continue with the import process. Import Items To import items, select \"Items\" under the \"Import type\" on the first page. When you click next, the page will load with the following tabs: Map to Omeka S data This tab displays a table with the columns from your spreadsheet as rows. Each row displays: a Checkbox Column header from the spreadsheet A plus symbol button for adding or modifying a mapping A wrench symbol button for spreadsheet column options A trash can to delete mappings A column to show options selected Mapping options To map a column header to a vocabulary property, click on the plus symbol button to the left of the column header. This will open a drawer on the right-hand side of the screen. The drawer has multiple options for mapping: Properties select a property to map the column data to, from any of the installed vocabularies. Use the Filter field to search the available properties for a specific property. Item-specific data has a dropdown to set Item Set by selected property. If you have a column with data for an Item Set to which you want to add the item, you can set how it maps using this dropdown. You can either use the Item Set's internal ID, or any one of its properties (title, description). Generic data also has a dropdown where you can set one of four options: Resource template (by label): set the template for an item by name. The name of the template as entered in the spreadsheet and the name of the template in Omeka S must match exactly. Resource class (by term): set the resource class for an item. The term for the class in the spreadsheet and in the Omeka S installation must match exactly. Owner (by email address): set an item's owner by email address. This must be the email address associated with the user's account in the Omeka S installation. Visibility public/private: set the visibility of the item. Use \"private\" or \"public\" in the spreadsheet. Media source If the column in your spreadsheet is a media source, select which kind from the dropdown: HTML IIIF Image (link) oEmbed (link) URL YouTube (link) Be sure to click the \"Apply Changes\" at the bottom of the drawer or nothing you set here will be kept. To remove a mapping, click the trash can icon in the row for that data mapping. It will remove only the mapping, not the column data. If you have data in a column in your CSV which you do not want to bring in to your Omeka S installation, simply do not map that column to a property or data type. Column options To access options for data in a column of your csv (represented by a row in the import table), click the wrench icon for that column heading. Column options are in addition to mappings. If you add options without also mapping column data to resource, media, or other data, nothing will be imported. This will open a drawer on the right side of the browser window with the following options: Use multivalve separator: check this box to use the multivalue separator for data in this column. You set the multivalue separator in the initial import page, but you can change it in the Basic Settings tab. Language: is a field where you can set the language for this column using the IETF Language tag for the language in which the text is written. This will override what you have entered in basic settings. Data type: is a dropdown with at least three options, which correspond to the values one can use when adding properties to an item: Import as text (default). Import as URL reference. You can set the label for the URI by including the desired text after a space, for example: http://example.com This Is The Label Import as Omeka S resource ID. Note that you must have the correct ID for the resource. A resources' ID is the number sequence at the end of the url when on the view or edit page, so for /admin/item/11576 the ID is 11576. If you have certain modules installed, such as Numeric Data Types, there may be additional data type options supplied by those modules. Import values as private : check this box to set all property values in this column private. Be sure to click the Apply Changes button at the bottom of the drawer in order to save your changes. To remove a column option setting, click the wrench icon again and undo your changes manually. Batch edit When you select one or more rows in the table (columns from your csv file), you can use the \"Batch edit options\" button to apply the column options described above - multivalue separator, language, data type, and property privacy - to multiple csv columns at once. Be sure to click the Apply Changes button at the bottom of the drawer in order to save your changes. Item import Basic Settings These settings apply to the entire csv which you are importing. Note that some of these settings can be overwritten by column options in the Map to Omeka S data tab. Resource Template: select a resource template from the drop-down menu to apply to the imported items. You can use the search field at the top of the dropdown to narrow results or find a particular template. Class: select a class from the drop-down menu to apply to the imported items. You can use the search field at the top of the dropdown to narrow results or find a particular class. Owner: set the owner for the Items by selecting a user from the drop-down menu. You can use the search field at the top of the dropdown to narrow results or find a particular user. Visibility: set the visibility of the imported items as public or private. Item Sets: add the imported items to a specific item set or sets using the dropdown menu. Multivalue Separator: enter the multivalue separator character here, if you have used one. The columns of data in your CSV should be separated by commas, however within those columns you can add a special character to create multiple inputs, for example a semicolon. Language: set the language of the values in the spreadsheet using the appropriate IETF Language tag . Item import Advanced Settings There are two options on this tab which are only for advanced use. Action This setting allows you to change the action of process from a straight import to one of the following options: Create a new resource: default option. Each row in the CSV will become a new resource. Append data to the resource: add new data to the resource. Revise data of the resource: replace existing data in the resource with data from the csv, except if empty. Update data of the resource: replace existing data in the resource with data from the csv, even when the cell is empty. Replace all data of the resource: remove all properties of the resource, and fill with new information from the sheet. Delete the resource: delete all matching resources If you select one of these options from the dropdown, three additional settings will appear on the tab. These settings help the process determine which resources to take action on. Resource identifier column: Select from a dropdown of the columns in your CSV. This is the data from your spreadsheet which maps to existing data in your Omeka S installation. Resource identifier property: select from a dropdown of all properties in your Omeka S installation. This should be the property in which you already have data, that you used to create the column data above. Example: if the data in the Resource identifier column is \"Title\" with the first row of data having a title \"A Study in Scarlet,\" and you set Resource identifier property to \"Dublin Core: Title,\" then the actions will operate on a resource already in your Omeka S installation whose dc:title property is \"A Study in Scarlet\". This will only work with exact matches. If you have more than one resource with matching data, it will only take action on the oldest resource. Action on unidentified resources: This option determines what to do when no matching resource exists in the Omeka S installation, but the selected action only applies to an existing resource (\"Append\", \"Revise\", \"Update\", or \"Replace\"). This option is not used when the main action is \"Create\" or \"Delete\" Your options are two radio buttons: Skip the row Create a new resource Other advanced settings In addition to the above, the Advanced Settings tab has an option to set the number of rows to process by batch. By default this is set to 20. However, if you are running into errors with an import you may want to set it to 5 or even 1 in order to troubleshoot and determine the source of the error. Complete import Once you have completed mappings, column options, and any settings, click the Import button in the upper right corner of the browser window. This should start the import and redirect you to the Past Imports tab. You should see a confirmation message saying \"Importing in Job ID [number]\" Import Item Sets To import item sets, select \"Item Set\" under the \"Import type\" on the first page. When you click next, the page will load with the following tabs: Map to Omeka S data This tab displays a table with the columns from your spreadsheet as rows. Each row displays: a Checkbox Column header from the spreadsheet A plus symbol button for adding or modifying a mapping A wrench symbol button for spreadsheet column options A trash can to delete mappings A column to show options selected Mapping options To map a column header to a vocabulary property, click on the plus symbol button to the left of the column header. This will open a drawer on the right-hand side of the screen. The drawer has multiple options for mapping: Properties select a property to map the column data to, from any of the installed vocabularies. Use the Filter field to search the available properties for a specific property. Item set-specific data is a checkbox for \"Open to additions.\" Check to allow other users to edit or add to the item set. Leave unchecked to have the item set be editable only by its creator, site admins, and global admins. Generic data also has a dropdown where you can set one of four options: Resource template (by label): set the template for an item set by name. The name of the template as entered in the spreadsheet and the name of the template in Omeka S must match exactly. Resource class (by term): set the resource class for an item set. The term for the class in the spreadsheet and in the Omeka S installation must match exactly. Owner (by email address): set an item set's owner by email address. This must be the email address associated with the user's account in the Omeka S installation. Visibility public/private: set the visibility of the item set. Use \"private\" or \"public\" in the spreadsheet. Be sure to click the \"Apply Changes\" at the bottom of the drawer or nothing you set here will be kept. To remove a mapping, click the trash can icon in the row for that data mapping. It will remove only the mapping, not the column data. If you have data in a column in your CSV which you do not want to bring in to your Omeka S installation, simply do not map that column to a property or data type. Column options To access options for data in a column of your csv (represented by a row in the import table), click the wrench icon for that column heading. Column options are in addition to mappings. If you add options without also mapping column data to resource, media, or other data, nothing will be imported. This will open a drawer on the right side of the browser window with the following options: Use multivalve separator: check this box to use the multivalue separator for data in this column. You set the multivalue separator in the initial import page, but you can change it in the Basic Settings tab. Language: is a field where you can set the language for this column using the IETF Language tag for the language in which the text is written. This will override what you have entered in basic settings. Data type: is a dropdown with at least three options, which correspond to the values one can use when adding properties to an item: Import as text (default). Import as URL reference. You can set the label for the URI by including the desired text after a space, for example: http://example.com This Is The Label Import as Omeka S resource ID. Note that you must have the correct ID for the resource. A resources' ID is the number sequence at the end of the url when on the view or edit page, so for /admin/item/11576 the ID is 11576. If you have certain modules installed, such as Numeric Data Types, there may be additional data type options supplied by those modules. Import values as private : check this box to set all property values in this column private. To remove a column option setting, click the wrench icon again and undo your changes manually. Batch edit When you select one or more rows in the table (columns from your csv file), you can use the \"Batch edit options\" button to apply the column options described above to multiple csv columns at once. Be sure to click the Apply Changes button at the bottom of the drawer in order to save your changes. Item Set import Basic Settings These settings apply to the entire csv which you are importing. Note that some of these settings can be overwritten by column options in the Map to Omeka S data tab. Resource Template: select a resource template from the drop-down menu to apply to the imported item sets. You can use the search field at the top of the dropdown to narrow results or find a particular template. Class: select a class from the drop-down menu to apply to the imported item sets. You can use the search field at the top of the dropdown to narrow results or find a particular class. Owner: set the owner for the item sets by selecting a user from the drop-down menu. You can use the search field at the top of the dropdown to narrow results or find a particular user. Visibility: set the visibility of the imported item sets as public or private. Open/Closed to additions: set whether users other than the owner (and site & global admins) will be able to add or edit the item sets. Multivalue Separator: enter the multivalue separator character here, if you have used one. The columns of data in your CSV should be separated by commas, however within those columns you can add a special character to create multiple inputs, for example a semicolon. Language: set the language of the values in the spreadsheet using the appropriate IETF Language tag . Item Set import Advanced Settings There are two options on this tab which are only for advanced use. Action This setting allows you to change the action of process from a straight import to one of the following options: Create a new resource: default option. Each row in the CSV will become a new resource. Append data to the resource: add new data to the resource. Revise data of the resource: replace existing data in the resource with data from the csv, except if empty. Update data of the resource: replace existing data in the resource with data from the csv, even when the cell is empty. Replace all data of the resource: remove all properties of the resource, and fill with new information from the sheet. Delete the resource: delete all matching resources If you select one of these options from the dropdown, three additional settings will appear on the tab. These settings help the process determine which resources to take action on. Resource identifier column: Select from a dropdown of the columns in your CSV. This is the data from your spreadsheet which maps to existing data in your Omeka S installation. Resource identifier property: select from a dropdown of all properties in your Omeka S installation. This should be the property in which you already have data, that you used to create the column data above. Example: if the data in the Resource identifier column is \"Title\" with the first row of data having a title \"A Study in Scarlet,\" and you set Resource identifier property to \"Dublin Core: Title,\" then the actions will operate on a resource already in your Omeka S installation whose dc:title property is \"A Study in Scarlet\". This will only work with exact matches. If you have more than one resource with matching data, it will only take action on the oldest resource. Action on unidentified resources: This option determines what to do when no matching resource exists in the Omeka S installation, but the selected action only applies to an existing resource (\"Append\", \"Revise\", \"Update\", or \"Replace\"). This option is not used when the main action is \"Create\" or \"Delete\" Your options are two radio buttons: Skip the row Create a new resource Other advanced settings In addition to the above, the Advanced Settings tab has an option to set the number of rows to process by batch. By default this is set to 20. However, if you are running into errors with an import you may want to set it to 5 or even 1 in order to troubleshoot and determine the source of the error. Complete import Once you have completed mappings, column options, and any settings, click the Import button in the upper right corner of the browser window. This should start the import and redirect you to the Past Imports tab. You should see a confirmation message saying \"Importing in Job ID [number]\" Import Media To import media, select \"media\" under the \"Import type\" on the first page. In order to import media, you must have a column in the csv which will map to item data. Media cannot exist unless associated with an item. Note that if you are running an advanced job, such as an update or replace, then you do not have to have a column with associated item data. When you click next, the page will load with the following tabs: Map to Omeka S data This tab displays a table with the columns from your spreadsheet as rows. Each row displays: a Checkbox Column header from the spreadsheet A plus symbol button for adding or modifying a mapping A wrench symbol button for spreadsheet column options A trash can to delete mappings A column to show options selected Mapping options To map a column header to a vocabulary property, click on the plus symbol button to the left of the column header.

Use the Filter field to search the available properties for a specific property. Media-specific data has a dropdown to set the item to which the media should be added. You can either use the item's internal ID, or any one of its properties (title, description). A resources' interal ID is the number sequence at the end of the url when on the view or edit page, so for /admin/item/11576 the ID is 11576 Generic data also has a dropdown where you can set one of four options: Resource template (by label): set the template for the media by name. The name of the template as entered in the spreadsheet and the name of the template in Omeka S must match exactly. Resource class (by term): set the resource class for the media. The term for the class in the spreadsheet and in the Omeka S installation must match exactly. Owner (by email address): set the media's owner by email address. This must be the email address associated with the user's account in the Omeka S installation. Visibility public/private: set the visibility of the media. Use \"private\" or \"public\" in the spreadsheet. Media source For the column in your spreadsheet which points to the media you are creating, select which kind of media it is from the dropdown: HTML IIIF Image (link) oEmbed (link) URL YouTube (link) Be sure to click the \"Apply Changes\" at the bottom of the drawer or nothing you set here will be kept.

On complete, the status of the import on the CSV Importer Past Imports table will say \"Undone\" followed by the date the import was reversed. Troubleshooting The following are known errors that can occur during an import: Encoding : CSVs for import must be UTF-8 encoded. CSV Import with other modules Some other modules add functionality to CSV import. If you have these modules installed and active, you will have access to the following options when using CSV import. Mapping If you have Mapping (minimum version 1.1.0) installed and active, you will have two additional options in the \"Map to Omeka S data\" tab when importing Items. Note that these options do not appear for any other import, including Mixed Resources. Resource location: set the location for the resource. Your column for this option can include one of the following forms of data: Latitude must be written as a single number (23.43 not 23\u00b0 26\u2032). Longitude must be written as a decimal fraction using negative and positive to indicate west or east. (\u221291 rather than 91\u00b0W) Latitude/longitude must be inputted as numbers separated by a slash, ex 52.19/ -1.71 Default map view: sets the default map view for the item to which you are adding Mapping information. Map center latitude must be written as a single number (23.43 not 23\u00b0 26\u2032). Map center longitude must be written as a decimal fraction using negative and positive to indicate west or east. (\u221291 rather than 91\u00b0W) Default zoom should be a number between 1 (most zoomed out) and 18 (most zoomed in) File Sideload If you have File Sideload (minimum version 1.2.0) installed and active, you can use it as a source for media when running a csv import. Everything on the Map to Omeka S data tab will be the same. When you add a mapping and choose the \"Media source\" option, you will see that there is now an option for \"Sideload\" . For the data in this column, you need to include the full file name, including extension. So, for example, if you want to import a jpg file which is named \"Jekyll_and_Hyde_Title\" then the data in the media column of the csv you are importing should be Jekyll_and_Hyde_Title.jpg . Numeric Data Types If you have Numeric Data Types installed and active, it will add the option to set a column data type as numeric data.","title":"CSV Import"},{"location":"modules/csvimport/#preparing-your-csv-file","text":"Most spreadsheet editors (including Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, and Apple Numbers) can export to csv format.

Note Your csv file must have a header row in order for the module to process it correctly. If you have multiple inputs for a single property, you can separate them with a secondary multivalue separator . For example, a work with multiple authors (E.B. White and William Strunk Jr.) with the column for Creator containing \"E.B. White; William Strunk Jr\" has a semicolon (;) as the multivalue separator.

It does this by adding a link below selected properties that reads \"See all items with this value\"; when clicked, the module returns the results of that search (property value is equal to input). In function it is similar to the Omeka Classic plugin Search by Metadata . The module's browse function is applied on the admin side when the module is active, and can be enabled on the public side of individual sites, on a site-by-site basis. Configuration Options Once you have installed and activated the module, you can configure it from the Modules tab of the left-hand navigation. Click the Configure button, with the wrench icon, to the right of the Metadata Browse label. The module has an option for global configuration settings on the admin side selecting properties to be applied on the admin side. The checkbox determines how the properties available for admin side metadata browsing (on items and item sets views) are determined: by aggregating the properties selected on all of the sites in the installation (unchecked) or limited to only the properties selected by a global administrator (checked). If the box is checked, there will be additional options to select properties. Global Configuration checkbox The module has one configuration setting, accessed from the Modules browse. The checkbox determines how the properties available for admin side metadata browsing (on items and item sets views) are determined: by aggregating the properties selected on all of the sites in the installation (unchecked) or limited to only the properties. When the box is unchecked , metadata browse on the admin side (and only the admin side) aggregates the metadata browse settings for all individual sites and applies them to every item and item set in the installation. Leaving the box unchecked allows installation users to browse the properties on the admin side which they have set as key on their sites. For example, a site about various artists might have the Metadata Browse enabled for 'Creator' (Dublin Core), while a site collecting conference papers might enable Metadata Browse for 'presented at' (Bibliographic Ontology); with the box unchecked, both 'Creator' and 'presented at' would have Metadata Browse enabled on the admin views of all items and item sets on the installation. When the box is checked , individual site settings still apply on the public views of those sites, but are not used on the admin side. Instead, only those properties selected in the Metadata Browse module configuration settings (the current page) are used on the admin side. So if the global admin of the installation example above checked the Global Configuration box and only enabled the properties 'Title' and 'Creator', then the 'presented at' property would not include a \"See all items with this value\" option on the admin side item browse. Checking the box can be used to limit the number of properties which have Metadata Browse enabled on the admin side. If, for example, the site about various artists mentioned above was using Metadata Browse on every possible property, those Metadata Browse links would still be visible on their site, but would not show up on the admin side. Instead, the Global Administrator(s) could decided which properties to enable browsing on for the admin side, thus reducing visual clutter. Choose properties Selecting properties for Metadata Browse in the Module configuration will only work if the use global configuration checkbox is checked. Select the properties from the sidebar by clicking on the desired property. It will load under the prompt \"Choose properties\".

Admin side browse Once you have selected properties for Metadata Browse, either in the configuration for the module or on at least one site, you will be able to search for exact matches to item and item set properties on the admin side. When viewing the metadata of any item (not when editing), you will see links for \"see all items with this value\" on any property which has been made active in Metadata Browse.

You can designate properties as either date and time (ISO) or integers. To install Numeric Data Types, follow the instructions for Installing Modules on the Modules documentation. Creating numeric properties To implement the module, you will need to create or edit a resource template to set specific properties as having numeric data types. When creating or editing a resource template, find the property you want to set as numeric in the right hand sidebar. Click on the property to add it to the template. Once the property has been added to the template, click the pencil/edit icon to edit the property. In the right hand drawer which opens, look for the dropdown \"Data type\" under the heading \"Other options\". In the dropdown, select from the following options under the heading for \"Numeric\": Timestamp, which can be as broad as year or as defined as the date and time; Integer, a whole number; Duration, for how long something lasted, with options for years down to seconds; Interval, a date-based range with start and end dates in each instance of the property. Be sure to click \"set changes\" at the bottom of the drawer to save this setting. When you save changes to your resource template, the numeric type you chose should show up in the column \"Data type\" for the template. Note: these fields will display only the numeric data entered. If you want to indicate what the integers represent, edit the property's label to include the scale you are using, for example creating an alternate label for \"Spatial Coverage\" which reads \"Height (cm)\". Entering numeric data When you add or edit an item using the template you created above, the properties you set as numeric will appear as follows: Timestamp data A Timestamp property automatically loads with fields for Year, Month, and Day. Note that the Month input is a dropdown where you select from the months' names. If you enter a day without a month, the day information will not be saved. Clicking on the \"time\" button to the right of the day input field will load additional dropdown fields for Hour, Minute, and Second. Note that there is no AM/PM option so you will want to use twenty-four hour time entries (14 for 2pm, etc) Entries must be whole numbers, with no decimal points. Integer data An integer property has a narrow input which, once you have data in it, will display up and down arrows on the right hand side to increase or decrease the value. Your entry must be whole number; decimal points are not supported and will be rounded up to the nearest number. Duration data A Duration property has a series of fields in which to enter the duration of the resource. There are fields for: Years Months Days Hours Minutes Seconds By default, only the first three of these fields display. Clicking on the \"time\" button to the right of the day input field will load the fields for Hour, Minute, and Second. Note that there is no AM/PM option so you will want to use twenty-four hour time entries (14 for 2pm, etc) You do not need to enter every field. For example, you can enter a duration of 1 year and 5 days, leaving the month field blank. Interval data Interval data allows you to enter the beginning and end dates for a resource. There are two sets of timestamp fields, one for the start date and one for the end. Sorting Once you have active resource templates using numeric data types, you can use these to sort on the Item, Media, and Item Set browse views. Click the first dropdown on the upper right above the table of resources, which defaults to \"Created\" Clicking on this dropdown will reveal multiple options, including all of the properties using numeric data types. These options display as the property with the data type in parentheses, for example \"Date (numeric:timestamp)\" Numeric data search When the module is active, it adds additional search options to the Advanced Search for items. For each search option, you must select a specific property from the dropdown; if you are using Duration in two resource templates, one for film (ex time:hasDuration ) and one for events (ex, dcterms:extent ), you would need to select the correct property from the resource template which you want to search. The dropdown will display the original property labels ( Extent or hasDuration in the examples above). If you hover over the properties in the dropdown, it will show you the resource templates which are using that property and to which the search will apply. Timestamp data has two search options, one for \"Date comes before\" and \"Date comes after\". Select the property for timestamp from the dropdown - only properties which are being used for timestamp will appear in the dropdown. Duration data, like timestamp data, has two options, for Duration is greater than and duration is less than. After selecting the property you want to search on, enter values for years, months, days, hours, minutes, or seconds. Date in interval searches for a date within an interval. When searching on an interval, be as precise as possible. Because of the way that the module stores timestamps, the date you are searching must fall within the interval. So a search for the year 1814 would not turn up an event with interval September 12-15, 1814, because of the way the data reads the two dates.

Set Homepage By default, the topmost page in the navigation acts the main page for your site. Note that custom URLs will not work as a home page - the topmost item in your navigation must be a page. You can set the homepage without changing the order of your pages using the Select a homepage section in the righthand drawer. This section has a dropdown which lists all the pages in your site. Simply select the page which you want to use as your homepage. To change which page is used as the homepage, select a different page from the dropdown. If you want to revert to using the top page in the navigation, click the 'x' to the right of the page name in the menu (circled in red in the below image). Adding Navigation Add to the navigation of the site using the options on the right hand side of the page. There are two sections: Add a custom link and Add a link to a site page Add a custom link To add a link you can use the Add a custom link options on the right hand drawer to add: * a Custom URL to any web address; * a Browse page for items on your site; * a Browse page for item sets on your site. Or you can add one of your pages , which should be listed in the right-hand drawer below the Add a custom link dropdown. If you need to find a specific page, begin typing the page title in the search box with the helper text Filter pages which appears directly below the text \u201cAdd a link to a site page.\u201d Custom URL link blocks display three pieces of information: the block type (Custom URL), the label which is the text which will appear in the site navigation menu, and the url . URL Block Browse blocks create a browse page for resources already associated with your site. There are blocks to create a browse items page and a block to browse item sets. You can change the label of the block to reflect what, specifically, site visitors will browse. If you want to refine the Browse block, you can use the Query to create a search query that returns the desired results. Note that you must enter a query for the block to function. To create a Browse Item Set navigation for all the item sets which you have already assigned to the resources with the site on which you are working: (In a separate window): conduct an advanced item set search using your site for the \"In site pool\" option. Once the search results load, highlight everything in your browser's address bar starting with the question mark all the way to the end of the search url (to the right). Paste the text you just copied into the \"Query\" field of the Browse item sets Navigation link. Site Page Site page blocks create links to pages you have built for your site. The page field indicates which page is in use, as does the block title. You can change the label for the page link in the navigation, as in the example image below. Note that changing the label does not change the page title. Site Page block If you have many pages, you can use the Filter pages field to find the names and slugs of specific pages.

In the example below, the media has a thumbnail type of \"medium\", alignment \"right, and attachment title of the \"item title\": Placing a media block after an HTML block will cause the media to appear below the end of the HTML paragraphs. Browse Preview Allows you to add a block of items on a site page. In order to create a Browse Preview block, you'll first need to perform a search on your Omeka S installation for the items you want to include. You can use the general search on the left hand navigation or, if you want to show all items in an item set, use the Advanced Search from Items browse. NB: if you leave the search options blank, the browse preview will load all items in your site's item pool.

Item Pool is where you can set the items available for selection and browse in your site. Item Sets is where you select the sets which will show up on the Browse Item Sets page, should you choose to include it Note The two tabs operate independently from each other. The selections made on one will have no effect on the other. The Item Pool tab limits which items are available, while The Item Set tab limits which sets are visible for public browsing. Item Pool The Item Pool determines what automatically appears in the resource selection options on the pages of your Omeka S site . It also limits the resources which appear on a browse page on your site. Note that the search options for the Item Pool work together to build an overall search. If you had the search in the image above, looking for items where \"Creator\" contains the word \"Doyle\" and you added a criteria where Class=Text, it would only add items to your pool which matched both statements. The settings in the Item Pool tab allow you to set the parameters for the pool. You can use one or more of the search options: Search by value: search for a term or phrase which you enter The first selector allows you to specify a property to search. The second selector allows you to set the relationship the property has with the value. The options are: is exactly, is not exactly, contains, does not contain, is resource with ID, is not resource with ID, has any value (there is something in the property), and has no values. Finally, there is a text field for you to enter the value you want the property to have. To find a resource ID, go to the resource and look at the url in your browser's address bar. The numbers at the end of the url are the resource ID. Search by Class: select one or more classes from the dropdown menu - the search will only return items with this class. Search by template: select from existing resource templates and the search will only return items using this resource template or templates. Search by item set: select from a dropdown of item sites. If you have already set terms for an item pool, the Item Pool page will display a message above the table of search options, with the number of items in the current site pool (see the image below). The number functions as a link which takes you to an admin-side browse of all the items in the site's item pool. Note that clicking the link takes you outside of the Sites admin The image below shows how those items are displayed; the name of the site is displayed just under the header for items. Note that we are back in the Items section of the Omeka S install admin, rather than the Site admin.

You do not need to select the current site - this dropdown is only there so you can build searches using other sites' pools. Item Sets On this tab you can select which Item Sets will display on a Browse Item Sets page when added to the navigation .

If you have already set terms for an item pool, the Item Pool page will display a message above the table of search options, with the number of items in the current site pool (see the image below). The number functions as a link which takes you to an admin-side browse of all the items in the site's item pool. Note that clicking the link takes you outside of the Sites admin The image below shows how those items are displayed; the name of the site is displayed just under the header for items.
